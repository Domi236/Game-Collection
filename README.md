# GAME COLLECTION
A small web project to see all games you can play if you visit me. <br>
It's based on plan html/scss/js an gulp.

### Setup
*  Download or clone this project to your dev environment.
*  go to the directory where you cloned it and run ```npm install```
*  run the command ```gulp``` to create dist folder (you need it once for the watcher)

Yeah and that's it! <br>
Now you should have a structure like this: <br>

#### Gulp Tasks
We use [GULP](https://gulpjs.com/) in this project. It's a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something.<br>
These are the gulp commands you could use at the moment:

| Command              | Description
| -------------------- |------------
| gulp                 | default gulp command - build dist folder once
| gulp scss            | build and minifies css files out of sass
| gulp js              | build an minifies all js files

<br>
<hr>

### Deployment
I know this is not really a topic for this project, but I think it's not that unnecessary. :wink: <br>
If you want do deploy your work on a server you just have to upload the stuff from ```dist``` folder.


### License
MIT License so everybody could use and modify it for his own purpose.
